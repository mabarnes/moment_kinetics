# List of Manufactured Solutions Test TOML inputs

Here we list the existing manufactured solution test inputs.

# 1D1V tests

There are 1D1V tests which complement the check-in testing suite.
The example input files in this category are as follows:

* 1D1V simulation of kinetic ions (no neutrals) and numerical
  velocity dissipation.

runs/1D-wall_MMS_new_nel_r_1_z_16_vpa_16_vperp_1_diss.toml
```
* 1D1V simulation of kinetic ions (no neutrals) and a krook
  collision operator.
```
