"""
Lagrange polynomials can be useful for finite element methods on any set of basis points,
as they give a representation of the interpolating function within an element whose
coefficients are just the function values at the grid points.

This module collects some functions related to the use of Lagrange polynomials, to avoid
their being scattered (and possibly duplicated) in other modules.

    lagrange_poly_optimised(other_nodes, one_over_denominator, x)

Optimised version of Lagrange polynomial calculation, making use of pre-calculated quantities.

`other_nodes` is a vector of the grid points in this element where this Lagrange
polynomial is zero (the other nodes than the one where it is 1).

`one_over_denominator` is `1/prod(x0 - n for n ∈ other_nodes)` where `x0` is the grid
point where this Lagrange polynomial is 1.

`x` is the point to evaluate the Lagrange polynomial at.
