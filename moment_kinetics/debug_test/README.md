Shared memory debugging
=======================

This `debug_test` directory contains scripts for running a set of short runs, intended
to be used with the `--debug` flag to check for bugs (e.g. race conditions).
The output is not checked - the intention is just to catch errors raised by the
debugging checks.

The inputs only have 3 time-steps, and very few grid points, because the debug checks
are very slow. The actual output is not important, so it does not matter that the runs
are badly under-resolved.

It may be necessary to use the `--compiled-modules=no` flag to Julia for changes
to the `--debug` setting to be picked up correctly. This setting means that all
precompilation is redone each time Julia is started, which can be slow. An
alternative workaround is to hard-code the
[`moment_kinetics.debugging._debug_level`](@ref) variable in `debugging.jl` to
the desired value.

To run the debug tests, call (from the top-level `moment_kinetics` directory)
something like
```
julia --project --check-bounds=yes --compiled-modules=no debug_test/runtests.jl --debug 99
```

Finding race conditions
-----------------------
The code is parallelized using MPI with shared memory arrays. 'Race conditions'
can occur if a shared array is accessed incorrectly. All the processes sharing
an array can be synchronized, ensuring they pass through the following code
block with a consistent state, by using the `_block_synchronize()` function
(which calls `MPI.Barrier()` to synchronize the processes). Race conditions
occur if between consecutive calls to `_block_synchronize()` any array is:
1. written by 2 or more processes at the same position
2. written by one process at a certain position, and read by one or more other
   processes at the same position.

If a race condition occurs, it can result in errors in the results. These are
sometimes small, but often show inconsistent results between runs (because
results erroneously depend on the execution order on different processes). They
are undefined behaviour though, and so can also cause anything up to segfaults.

The provided debugging routines can help to pin down where either of these
errors happen.

The `@debug_shared_array` macro (activated at `--debug 2` or
higher) counts all reads and writes to shared arrays by each process, and
checks at each `_block_synchronize()` call whether either pattern has occurred
since the previous `_block_synchronize()`. If they have and in addition
`@debug_track_array_allocate_location` is active (`--debug 3` or higher), then
the array for which the error occured is identified by printing a stack-trace
of the location where it was allocated, and the stack-trace for the exception
shows the location of the `_block_synchronize()` call where the error occured.

`@debug_block_synchronize` (activated at `--debug 4`)checks that all processes
called `_block_synchronize()` from the same place - i.e. the same line in the
code, checked by comparing stack traces.

`@debug_detect_redundant_block_synchronize` (activated at `--debug 5`) aims to
find any unnecessary calls to `_block_synchronize()`. These calls can be
somewhat expensive (for large numbers of processes at least), so it is good to
minimise the number. When this mode is active, at each `_block_synchronize()` a
check is made whether there would be a race-condition error if the previous
`_block_synchronize()` call was removed. If there would not be, then the
previous call was unnecessary and could be removed. The tricky part is that
whether it was necessary or not could depend on the options being used...
Detecting redundant `block_synchronize()` calls requires that all dimensions
that could be split over processes are actually split over processes, which
demands a large number of processes are used. The
`@debug_detect_redundant_block_synchronize` flag, when activated, modifies the
splitting algorithm to force every dimension to be split if possible, and raise
an error if not.

Suggested debugging strategy for race conditions is:
* Look at the loop types and ensure that there is an appropriate
  `begin_*_region()` call before each new loop type.
* Run `debug_test/runtests.jl` with `@debug_shared_array` activated, but not
  `@debug_detect_redundant_block_synchronize`. It will be faster to first run
  without `@debug_track_array_allocate_location` to find failing tests, then
  with `@debug_track_array_allocate_location` to help identify the cause of the
  failure. Usually a failure should indicate where there is a missing
  `begin_*_region()` call. There may be places though where synchronization is
  required even though the type of loop macros used does not change (for
  example when `phi` is calculated contributions from all ion species need
  to be summed, resulting in an unusual pattern of array accesses); in this
  case `_block_synchronize()` can be called directly.
    * The function `debug_check_shared_memory()` can be inserted between
      `begin_*_region()` calls when debugging to narrow down the location where
      the incorrect array access occured. It is defined when
      `@debug_shared_array` is active, and can be imported with `using
      ..communication: debug_check_shared_memory()`. The function runs the same
      error checks as are added by `@debug_shared_array` in
      `_block_synchronize()`.
    * The tests in `debug_test/` check for correctness by looping over the
      dimensions and forcing each to be split over separate processes in turn.
      This allows the correctness checks to be run using only 2 processes,
      which would not be possible if all dimensions had to be split at the same
      time.
* [This final level of checking only looks for minor optimizations rather than
  finding bugs, so it is much less important than the checks above.] Run
  `debug_test/debug_redundant_synchronization/runtests.jl` with
  `@debug_detect_redundant_block_synchronize` activated. This should show if
  any call to `_block_synchronize()` (including the ones inside
  `begin_*_region()` calls) was 'unnecessary' - i.e. there would be no
  incorrect array accesses if it was removed. This test needs to be run on a
  suitable combination of grid sizes and numbers of processes so that all
  dimensions are split across multiple processes to avoid false positives.  Any
  redundant calls which appear in all tests can be deleted.  Redundant calls
  that appear in only some tests (unless they are in some code block that is
  just not called in all the other tests) should preferably be moved inside a
  conditional block, so that they are called only when necessary, if a suitable
  one exists. If there is no conditional block that the call can be moved to,
  it may sometimes be necessary to just test one or more options before
  calling, e.g.
  ```
  moments.evolve_upar && _block_synchronize()
  ```
    * The checks for redundant `_block_synchronize()` calls have been separated
      from the correctness checks so that the correctness checks can be run in
      the CI using only 2 processes, while the redundancy checks can be run
      manually on a machine with enough memory and cpu cores.

You can find out what loop type is currently active by looking at
`loop_ranges[].parallel_dims`. This variable is a Tuple containing Symbols for
each dimension currently being parallelized.
