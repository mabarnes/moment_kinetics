Communication functions and setup

Split the grid into 'blocks'. Each block can use shared memory (MPI shared memory
arrays). At the moment only works with a single 'block' containing the whole grid -
eventually add more MPI communication functions to communicate between blocks. A block
should probably be a 'NUMA region' for maximum efficiency.

Note: charge-exchange collisions loop over neutral species for each ion species. At the
moment this loop is not parallelised (although it could be, by introducing some more
loop ranges), as at the moment we only run with 1 ion species and 1 neutral species.

Get a shared-memory array of `mk_float` (shared by all processes in a 'block')

Create a shared-memory array using `MPI.Win_allocate_shared()`. Pointer to the memory
allocated is wrapped in a Julia array. Memory is not managed by the Julia array though.
A reference to the `MPI.Win` needs to be freed - this is done by saving the `MPI.Win`
into a `Vector` in the `Communication` module, which has all its entries freed by the
`finalize_comms!()` function, which should be called when `moment_kinetics` is done
running a simulation/test.

Arguments
---------
dims - mk_int or Tuple{mk_int}
    Dimensions of the array to be created. Dimensions passed define the size of the
    array which is being handled by the 'block' (rather than the global array, or a
